# Groove

A self-hosted, browser-based Git client with a built-in terminal. Run it on your Mac, then access it from any device on your [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) network — including your phone.

## What it does

- Browse all Git repos found in your home directories (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.)
- View repo status, current branch, last commit, and diffs
- Edit files directly in the browser
- Stage, commit, and push changes
- Open a full interactive terminal scoped to any repo
- Installable as a PWA on mobile and desktop

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v18+
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) installed and connected on the host machine (for remote access)
- Git configured with push access to your remotes

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/groove.git
cd groove
npm install
npm start
```

The server starts on port `9000` and binds to all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`).

## Accessing it

**Locally:**
```
http://localhost:9000
```

**From another device via Tailscale:**
```
http://<tailscale-ip>:9000
```

Your Tailscale IP is printed in the terminal when the server starts. It's also shown in the app's UI. Tailscale IPs always start with `100.x.x.x`.

To find your Tailscale IP manually:
```bash
tailscale ip -4
```

## Install as a PWA

On mobile (iOS/Android) or desktop, open the app in your browser and use "Add to Home Screen" / "Install app" to get a native-like experience with no browser chrome.

## Port conflict

If port `9000` is already in use:
```bash
lsof -ti :9000 | xargs kill -9
```

## Security note

The server has no authentication. It exposes your filesystem and a live terminal. Only run it on a trusted network or behind Tailscale — do not expose it to the public internet.
